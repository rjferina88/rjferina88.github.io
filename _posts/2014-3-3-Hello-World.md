There's nothing fancy here. I'm experimenting with GitHub, and trying to build a static web page using the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

If you are here to find out about my bot generated tweets, the basis for that experiment came from a Medium article located [here.](https://medium.com/science-friday-footnotes/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-in-under-an-hour-259597558acf#.hlr8dysi2)
